## Project Description

Our project involves designing and implementing an Android mobile application- VibeCheck, aimed at helping university students and staff track and share their moods. The app’s primary goal is to provide insights into emotional states and their triggers, enhancing users’ understanding of their mental well-being amidst the challenges of academic life. The application must be simple, attractive, easy to use, and designed with flexibility to allow future extensions or migrations.

Here’s a breakdown of the VibeChecks' purpose and features:

**Core Purpose**
The app enables users to:

1. **Log and Reflect:** Record mood events to track their emotional experiences over time.
2. **Share and Connect:** Share moods with others (optionally) to foster a sense of community or gain support.
3. **Analyze Patterns:** Use filters and maps to identify trends or triggers in their emotional states, which can support mental health awareness.
It’s tailored for the university context, where stress and emotional fluctuations are common, making it a valuable tool for students and staff alike.


## Key Features

1. **MOOD EVENT CREATION AND MANAGEMENT**
   
This feature allows users to log their mood events comprehensively and manage them with ease. Users can:
- **Add new mood events** by specifying their emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, stressed), the reason or trigger for the mood (via text or photograph), the social situation (e.g., alone, with friends), and privacy settings.

- **View, edit, or delete** existing mood events to keep their records up-to-date and reflective of their experiences.
- Attach optional details like geolocation to provide context to their emotional state.

This is the foundation of the app, enabling users to document their moods in a structured and detailed way, which is essential for personal tracking and later analysis


  
2. **MOOD HISTORY ANALYSIS**
   
This feature empowers users to reflect on and understand their emotional patterns over time by providing tools to analyze their mood history. Key aspects include:
- **Viewing** a chronological list of past mood events, sorted by date and time.
- **Filtering** mood events based on criteria such as time periods, emotional states, or keywords in the reason.
- **Visualizing** moods on a map when location data is available, offering a geographical perspective on emotional trends.

This analytical capability is crucial for users to gain insights into their mental well-being, identify triggers, and recognize patterns—especially valuable in the high-stress environment of university life.



3. **SOCIAL SHARING AND INTERACTION**
   
This feature fosters a sense of community by allowing users to connect and share their experiences. It includes:
- **Following** other users and granting permissions to view mood events based on privacy settings.
- **Viewing** a feed of public mood events from followed users, with the ability to filter them or see nearby moods on a map.
- **Commenting** on mood events to offer support, empathy, or advice, enhancing social engagement.
By integrating social elements, the app not only serves as a personal tool but also builds a supportive network, encouraging users to share and learn from each other’s emotional journeys.
